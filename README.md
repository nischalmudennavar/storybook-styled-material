## React + TypeScript + Vite + Styled Components + Material UI  + tailwind ( addon )

This is a custom setup for building DLS with different css methods under one roof :) 

to get started you need to run two servers : 

tailwind-watch :  ```npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch```

Storybook : ```yarn stroybook```

⚠️ :-> this is completely experimental and all the edge cases havent been tested yet.
